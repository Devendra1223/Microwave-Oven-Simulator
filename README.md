# Internship Project ‚Äì Microwave Oven Simulation

Welcome to the repository for my internship project titled: **Microwave Oven Simulation**.

This project was developed during my internship at **EMERTXE**, a company specializing in embedded systems and IoT training. During this internship, I gained practical experience working with **MPLAB X IDE** and the **PICSimLab Simulator**.

### üë®‚Äçüíª About the Project
As part of the project, I wrote code in **Embedded C** to interface various peripherals of the **PIC16F877A microcontroller**. The goal was to simulate the core functionalities of a microwave oven.

The simulation includes the following four operational modes:
1. **Micro Mode**
2. **Grill Mode**
3. **Convection Mode**
4. **Start Mode**

Each mode was implemented and tested in a simulated embedded environment.
